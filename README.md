## Portfolio User Story
As a recruiter: I want to find the best talent available for roles I'm looking to fill. I want to know their background, skills and capabilities, as well as see projects they've created.
This is so I can instantly recognise talented candidates looking for work, and find a great fit for both them and their employer.


## Getting Started 
Users arrive on the home page/About Me. They can then navigate to my portfolio of work and contact form via the top-right menu.
From the Portfolio page, users can click on the pictures to view projects I have built.
